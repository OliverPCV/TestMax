# TestMax #

TestMax is integrated Software Testing framework which can be used to test distributed system by developing rapid test cases using XML configuration in front and backend that talks to each other within the test framework. This tool can be used for Database, webservice, API, Junit, TestNg and Frontend including performance test.

The main advantage of this TestMax architecture is separating test data configuration from test case run time environment. It reduces the maintenance of test cases only limited to different test set and test data to run the same test into different QA env without writing or maintaining any test code.
